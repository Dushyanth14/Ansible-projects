# Ansible User Management Automation

## Overview
Ansible User Management Automation is a simple yet powerful project that automates tasks related to user management. It allows you to check if a user exists on remote servers, create new users with specific user IDs, and set their passwordsâ€”all through Ansible playbooks. This project simplifies user administration tasks and improves efficiency in managing multiple systems.

## Features
- **Check if a user exists**: Verifies whether a user already exists on the system.
- **Display user details**: Retrieves and displays user account details like expiration and password status.
- **Create new users**: Automatically creates new users with a custom user ID and sets their password.
- **Interactive prompts**: The playbook asks for user input for various parameters (username, user ID, password).

## Requirements
- **Ansible**: Version 2.9 or higher.
- **Python**: Version 3.x.
- **Sudo privileges**: Required on the target machines to manage users.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yDushyanth14/ansible-user-management.git

## Install Ansible if it's not already installed:
pip install ansible

## Prepare your inventory file (hosts.txt) to define the target machines.

## How to Use
1. Modify the hosts.txt file to list the target hosts you want to manage.

2. Run the Ansible playbook with the following command:
   ansible-playbook -i hosts.txt user_automation.yml

 $ ansible-playbook -i hosts.txt user_automation.yml
 - Enter the username to be checked: (USER NAME)
